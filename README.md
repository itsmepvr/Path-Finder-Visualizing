# Path Finder: Visualizing Shortest Route Algorithms

This project offers a visual platform for exploring and comparing various shortest route finding algorithms. It demonstrates the functionality of algorithms like A\*, Dijkstra's, BFS, DFS, and Greedy Best First Search through interactive visualizations on graphs.

## Features

- **Algorithm Selection:** Users can choose from five different algorithms.
- **Random Graph Generation:** Randomly generated graphs with source and destination points.
- **Visualization:** Immediate visualization of the algorithm's process on the graph.
- **Offline Operation:** The project operates entirely offline, providing a self-contained environment for users.

## Algorithms Included

- **A\* Algorithm:** Balances cost and heuristic to find optimal paths.
- **Dijkstra's Algorithm:** Finds shortest paths in weighted graphs without negative edges.
- **Breadth First Search:** Guarantees shortest path in unweighted graphs.
- **Depth First Search:** Explores deeply but doesnâ€™t guarantee the shortest path.
- **Greedy Best First Search:** Prioritizes speed over optimality using heuristic guidance.

## Technologies Used
